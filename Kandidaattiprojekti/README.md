# Snowledge
For this project we created a mobile app and the back-end server the app needs for Pallaksen Pöllöt. Pallaksen Pöllöt has the website https://lumisovellus.fi/ that shows the current snow situation at the Pallas tunturi region. They wanted a companion app so that skiers in the region could ask for help from other people nearby if they ran into trouble. I was mainly in charge of the server side development and helped debug some connectivity problems on the mobile app in the later stages of the project.

For iOS the mobile app is available at https://apps.apple.com/fi/app/pallaksen-p%C3%B6ll%C3%B6t/id1620549112
