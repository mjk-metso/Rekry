# Snowledge
For this project we created a mobile app and the back-end server required for Pallaksen Pöllöt. Pallaksen Pöllöt has the website https://lumisovellus.fi/ that shows the current snow situation at the Pallas tunturi region. They wanted a companion app so that skiers in the region could ask for help from other people nearby if they ran into trouble. I was mainly in charge of the server side development and helped debug some connectivity problems on the mobile app in the later stages of the project.
